Test Plan: BLE RF Validation - Antenna Placement and Noise Margin

1. Setup:
   - Device under test: Embedded ECU with BLE
   - Tools: Spectrum Analyzer, BLE scan logger, Signal Generator

2. Tests:
   a. Static test at 1m, 5m, 10m
      - Log RSSI, SNR
   b. Test in presence of EMI source (motor, Wi-Fi)
      - Record RSSI drop, calculate interference margin
   c. Orientation sensitivity test (90°, 180°)

3. Expected Results:
   - RSSI > -75 dBm at 5m in clean environment
   - BLE stability > 90% packet detect rate
   - Max deviation under EMI < 10 dB

4. Record log in CSV format for analysis
